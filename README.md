This project was initially cloned from branch 
7.x-3.0-beta2 from the project at 
https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalpro

However, the entire project at the above URL
was NOT copied.  Only the drush commands
in the subdirectory ./drush_addons/quickstart
were copied.

In other words, the DrupalPro project included
many items to install a "full" Drupal development
environment into a Ubuntu 12.04 system.  This 
included Apache, MySQL, editors etc.  

This subset of the DrupalPro (formerly Drupal Quickstart')
scripts only included those Drush commands to setup
databases, Apache virtual servers etc.
